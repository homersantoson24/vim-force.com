DESCRIPTION                                             *force.com-description*

force.com plugin is a bunch of .vim scripts which allow to develop on force.com 
platform using only web browser and Vim

It is designed for those who do not feel productive in Force.com IDE for Eclipse

Installation/System requirements 

Before force.com plugin can be used following requirements must be met:

1. Vim version 7.3 or later with :set nocompatible
	There is a chance that it will work with 7.2 as well, but I have not tested

2. Java JDK/JRE, Version 6.1 or greater
   tested with OpenJDK and Oracle JDK
   - java version "1.6.0_18" OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.8.10)
   - Oracle JDK
     http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

   JDK is not strictly required, JRE will suffice.
   With JRE Ant will complain about missing tools.jar but it is safe to ignore this warning


3. Apache ANT 
   tested with Apache Ant(TM) 
   - version 1.8.2 on Win XP SP3
   - version 1.8.0 on Linux

4. Force.com Migration Tool  
	Tested with salesforce_ant_19.0

    Download it as described here:
    http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Force.com_Migration_Tool#How_to_Install

    ant-salesforce.jar library must be made available to ANT

    The order in which jars are added to the classpath is as follows:

    * -lib jars in the order specified by the -lib elements on the command line
    * jars from ${user.home}/.ant/lib (unless -nouserlib is set)
    * jars from ANT_HOME/lib

    see http://ant.apache.org/manual/running.html#libs for more details
    as well as
    http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/apexcode/Content/apex_deploying_ant.htm

5. On MS Windows Install shortname.vim 
    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=433

6. Unpack force.com plugin archive anywhere you like

ex: ~/vim/force.com

7. Add 'force.com' folder to vim runtime path and make sure it loads apexcode filetype detection

e.g.
	if has("unix")
		let &runtimepath=&runtimepath . ',~/vim/force.com'
	elseif has("win32")
		let &runtimepath=&runtimepath . ',c:\Documents and Settings\username\vimfiles\force.com'
	endif
	" make sure vim loads apexcode filetype detection
	runtime ftdetect/apexcode.vim

8. Enable filetype plugin and syntax highlighting

e.g. add these lines into .vimrc (or _vimrc on windows)
	filetype plugin on
	syntax on

8. Index help file

e.g.
    :helptags ~/vim/force.com/doc

    Or if using with pathogen.vim plugin and force.com is in .vim/bundle run
    :Helptags

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS                                             *force.com-limitations*

vim force.com plugin does not support creating force.com project. Use provided
template instead.

ant-salesforce.jar library does not (in most cases) report error line numbers
in Visualforce pages making it impossible to go-to actual problem line if
compile/save fails due to syntax error. This is similar to Force.com IDE for
Eclipse.

Current version does not support environment aware code completion
For example if you write >
	String val = 'abc';
< typing >
	val.
< will not bring the list of String methods as Force.com IDE may do.

"Execute Anonymous" and "Run test" features are not implemented. Use your favourite 
web browser in the meantime.

On MS Windows default configuration spawns separate DOS/CMD window on every call
to command line utility, ex: ant deploy
It looks like there is a way to overcome this but I have not tried it
@see shell.vim - http://peterodding.com/code/vim/shell/

Credit must go out to Bram Moolenaar and all the Vim developers for
making the world's best editor (IMHO). I also want to thank everyone who
helped and gave me suggestions. I wouldn't want to leave anyone out so I
won't list names.
